The first review warns against purchasing the game until it is more stable, suggesting it is still in an alpha state. Although some reviews praise the gameplay and updates, the recurring issues with corrupted saves and performance on lower-end systems make it a risky purchase at this time."

The warning to wait for a year before purchasing indicates that the game may still not be in a stable state, which is a red flag for potential buyers. Overall, the mixed feedback suggests it might be better to hold off on buying the game for now."
